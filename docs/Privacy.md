### 1. Information We Collect

**1.1 User Preferences and Email**
- We collect and store user preferences (e.g., your selected login provider: Google or Facebook) and the email address you provide through Chrome’s `storage.sync` API. This information is saved to personalize your experience and synchronize settings across your devices.

  - **Facebook**: We access your Facebook login status by checking the `c_user` cookie from `facebook.com` to determine if you're logged in to Facebook.

**1.3 Tab and Website Activity**
- We use the `activeTab` and `tabs` permissions to interact with the currently active tab when necessary, such as detecting login pages or checking for relevant login buttons.

### 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:
- Facilitate the login process with your preferred provider (Google or Facebook).
